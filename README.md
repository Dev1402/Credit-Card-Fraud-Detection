# Fraud
In this project, we will build and deploy the following two machine learning algorithms:

Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
Isolation Forest Algorithm
Furthermore, using metrics suchs as precision, recall, and F1-scores, we will investigate why the classification accuracy for these algorithms can be misleading.

In addition, we will explore the use of data visualization techniques common in data science, such as parameter histograms and correlation matrices, to gain a better understanding of the underlying distribution of data in our data set. Let's get started
